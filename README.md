MATLAB codes for simulating the worm peristaltic motion.

Our lab has designed and made a worm robot which can do peristaltic motion. For better understanding of the motion as well as the control methods, I wrote these simulation codes which can behave just like our lab's real robot.
The inputs for Version 1.0 are quite different from our real actuator(AX-18A) inputs, whereas for Version 2.0 inputs are exactly the same.
With this simulation, we can always try new control methods first in the codes to avoid breakage which often accur in the robot. And we can do various kinds of annalysis within the simulation like skidmark analysis, bias analysis, speed analysis and so on, which can help improve the control methods.
