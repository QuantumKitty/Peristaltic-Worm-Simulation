MATLAB codes for simulating the worm peristaltic motion

Our lab has designed and made a worm robot which can do peristaltic motion. For better understanding of the motion as well as the control methods, I wrote these simulation codes which can behave just like our lab's real robot.
The inputs for Version 1.0 are quite different from our real actuator inputs, whereas for Version 2.0 inputs are exactly the same.
